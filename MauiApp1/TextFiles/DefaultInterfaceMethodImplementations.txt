Enables you to add new methods to existing interfaces without breaking them by defining a default method implementation.
Very similar to virtual methods in inheritance.
Do not need to use the override keyword when overriding the default implementation.
To access default implementations the class must be an instance of the interface type, not just an implementing class.
Allows parameterization of default methods with static members, but this should generally be avoided.
