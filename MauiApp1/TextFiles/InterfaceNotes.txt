Think of it as a contract. 
No implementation in interface, ie can contain no logic.
Implementing class must implement at least everything in interface (can have more). Naming convention capital ‘I’ then pascal case.
All members are implicitly public and cannot be changed. Interfaces can implement other interfaces. Classes can implement more than one interface.
A class can inherit from another class as well as implement an interface.
