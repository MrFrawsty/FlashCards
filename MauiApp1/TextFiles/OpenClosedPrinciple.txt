Objects should be open to extension but closed to modification.
Classes and methods should continue to work if you need to extend them.
Relying on interfaces instead of classes allows for greater flexibility.
Creating an interface for each changed implementation makes it easier to extend by simply swapping out one interface for another.
Treat class like itâ€™s in production and cannot be changed.
